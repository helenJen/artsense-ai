# 🎨 ArtSense AI

**ArtSense AI** is a Generative AI-powered virtual art critic and assistant that analyzes artwork and provides intelligent critiques — covering style, composition, mood, historical context, and more.

This project is a fusion of technology and art, aimed at empowering artists, collectors, and educators to better understand and engage with visual creativity.
